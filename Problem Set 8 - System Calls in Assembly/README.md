1.) Ran a program (pset8p1.c) using strace to observe the system calls made. <br />
2.) Wrote the above program in assembly (pset8p2.S) using SYSCALL. <br />
3.) Performed a system call in assembly with no exit (pset8p3-1.S), then one with an exit system call with a nonzero value (pset8p3-2.S). <br />
4.) Introduced errors in the program, using an invalid system call address (pset8p4-1.S) and an invalid message address (pset8p4-2.S). <br />
5.) Wrote a program (pset8p5.c) to see the cost in nanoseconds for an iteration through a for-loop, a function call, and a system call for a loop involving six million iterations. <br />
