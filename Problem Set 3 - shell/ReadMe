Simple Version of Unix Shell
Capable of launching one program at a time, with arguments, waiting for completion, and reporting the exit status and usage statistics.
Each command must be in the form:

command {argument {argument...} } {redirection_operation {redirection_operation...}}

The following redirect arguments are supported:

<filename     (Open filename and redirect to stdin)
>filename     (Open/create/truncate filename and redirect to stdout)
2>filename    (Open/create/truncate filename and redirect to stderr)
>>filename    (Open/create/append filename and redirect to stdout)
2>>filename   (Open/create/append filename and redirect to stderr)

The shell forks and execs the commands with a clean file descriptor environment (only 0, 1, and 2 are open).
This program can also be invoked as a shell interpreter (i.e., shell /tmp/myscript.sh). If this is done, the program will open and execute each line of the script as a command. Otherwise, the shell will read commands from stdin until EOF.
The shell program will exit with status 0 if no errors were encountered and all commands were launched. Otherwise, it will return with a nonzero status.
