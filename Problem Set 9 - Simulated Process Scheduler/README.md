A environment was created to simulate process scheduling, forking, exiting, waiting, and sleeping within a uniprocessor environment. This was done within a single-threaded Linux process. <br />
Distinct “user level” stacks are maintained for each process. <br />
Hardware interrupts were also simulated with signals. <br />
